#+title: Drones

How many objects can you control at the same time?

The goal of this project is to create a playground for testing that,
and maybe mold it into a full computer game somewhen later on.

** Controls

Use *Space* to spawn drones. Each drone is controlled by two keys, and
every new drone will take an unused key pair from the following set:

((r f) (u j) (e d) (i k) (w s) (o l) (q a)))
